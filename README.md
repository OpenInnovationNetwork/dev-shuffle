# [Shuffle](http://vestride.github.io/Shuffle) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Vestride/Shuffle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Vestride/Shuffle)

## The original repository demos
http://openinnovationnetwork.github.io/dev-shuffle/

## Vanilla demo
It's a folder to copy the same demos from the original repository, but without the jekyll dependencies.
It only needs the HTML inside this folder, and some of the CSS/JS from the original repo (folders dev-shuffle/js, dev-shuffle/dist, dev-shuffle/css).

Source code: https://github.com/OpenInnovationNetwork/dev-shuffle/tree/gh-pages/vanilla-demo

Demo: http://openinnovationnetwork.github.io/dev-shuffle/vanilla-demo/


## Vanilla demo with JSON
The difference is that the data comes from a JSON file in this same repository. As it is a public github pages repo, the files are available through a URL, so the ajax calls that URL directly. There is no need for Github API calls.

It also only needs the HTML inside this folder, and some of the CSS/JS from the original repo (folders dev-shuffle/js, dev-shuffle/dist, dev-shuffle/css).

## Next steps
- Pull the data from *our* JSON
- Make it work with our layout
